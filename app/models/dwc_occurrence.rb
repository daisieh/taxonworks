# A Darwin Core Record for the Occurence core.  Field generated from Ruby dwc-meta, which references
# the same spec that is used in the IPT, and the Dwc Assistant.  Each record
# references a specific CollectionObject or AssertedDistribution. 
#
# Important: This is a cache/index, data here are periodically (regenerated) from multiple tables in TW.  
#
# TODO: The basisOfRecord CVTs are not super informative.
#    We know collection object is definitely 1:1 with PreservedSpecimen, however
#    AssertedDistribution could be HumanObservation (if source is person), or ... what? if 
#    its a published record.  Seems we need a 'PublishedAssertation', just like we model the data.
#
# DWC attributes are camelCase to facilitate matching
# dwcClass is a replacement for the Rails reserved 'Class'
#
#
# All DC attributes (attributes not in DwcOccurrence::TW_ATTRIBUTES) in this table are namespaced to dc ("http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/")
