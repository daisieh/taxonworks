# A citation topic links a Topic to a Citation.  It is the assertion that a Citation contains
# information on a specific topic for the Citations subject. For example:
#
# Otu     Citation (Source)           CitationTopic  Topic (= ControlledVocabularyTerm of type "Topic") 
# Aus has Citation Smith (1920), with CitationTopics "Biology" on pages 21,22.
#
# This set of data asserts that the concept of Aus, an OTU, is circumscribed/described in full or part in Smith (1920), and that
# one of the subjects of that circumscription is its "Biology", specifically found on pages 21,22.
#
# @!attribute topic_id
#   @return [Integer]
#     the Topic in the specific citation 
#
# @!citation_id
#   @return [Integer]
#     The citation (links subject to source) 
#
# @!attribute pages
#   @return [String]
#     the pages that the specific Topic is listed on 
#
# @!attribute project_id
#   @return [Integer]
#   the project ID
